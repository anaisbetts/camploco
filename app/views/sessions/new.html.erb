Instead of asking you to create another username and password to register your troop, you can use your username from any of several sites like Yahoo! or your AIM screenname. They manage asking you for your password, so we don't store this information. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> We're having some troubles with login, especially via an AIM screenname. Sorry about that! Closing your browser and reopening it will help with these issues. Also, if you <i>use an AIM screenname</i>, make sure to <b>check the box</b> below the password labeled "Remember this site"
</p>

If you don't already use any of these services, or prefer to create a separate account for Lakota Badges, you can create one at <%= link_to 'MyOpenID', 'http://www.myopenid.com' -%>. If you have any problems, please contact the program director Janssen Lemley at 419-509-7100, or via Email at jwlemley5@hotmail.com.
